#1. Opens the data set
load("/cloud/project/MRMTch2.Rdata") #if using on Postit Cloud

# if using on desktop RStudio, use this instead (note that the data file will need to be in the same folder as this R script file)
# wd <- getwd() # this gets your working directory and saves it as an object in your R environment.
# setwd(wd) # this sets your working directory. 
# load("MRMTch2.Rdata") # this load the "ta_data" dataframe


#2. Snapshot of the data (top few rows of data set)
names(MRMTch2)
head(MRMTch2)  

#3. See each variable's type, value labels, etc. 
str(MRMTch2)  

#4. See the value labels for the nominal variable 'Gender'
attr(MRMTch2$Gender,"value.labels")  
attr(MRMTch2$MRS_1,"value.labels")  

#5. Frequency count for the Gender variable
table(MRMTch2$Gender)

#6. "Mean" of 'Gender,' even though it's not meaningful in this context
mean(MRMTch2$Gender)  

#7. To change the Sex variable from numeric to "factor" 
MRMTch2$Gender <- factor(MRMTch2$Gender,
                              levels = c(1,2),
                              labels = c("Male", "Female"))
str(MRMTch2$Gender)
table(MRMTch2$Gender)
mean(MRMTch2$Gender)

#8. Saving the revised data set under a new name
MRMTch3 <- MRMTch2
save(MRMTch3, file = "MRMTch3.Rdata")
